# S.tombeanensis-genome
Saxifraga tombeanensis genome assembly pipeline. 
Please note that all the annotated pipelines are suitable for fdalgrande@bio-orto, so if you're not using the server of the Botanical Garden of Padova you may have to change something.


## Quality Control
For quality control of PacBio HiFi reads we used FastQC. 

## Raw Assembly
Initial raw assembly was done with hifiasm.
